After downloading the very simple files to run the program, we are going into the PictureSimilarity folder, we follow the bin / debug path and run the PictureSimilarity application.

then we first select the first picture by clicking the select button on the left side of the screen, then click on the select button on the right side to select our second picture and click on the last start button to start the process.

And the result will appear on the screen :)
